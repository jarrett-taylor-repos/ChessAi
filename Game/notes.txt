unit test
-this will hold a unit test for each function written in secton based on File
-the functions will determine if passing or not and try and handle tons of cases and have logging
-will be difficult but useful


main 
-will use to call functions and run


game
-this will have a chessboard property and this will allow for deep copy and all for more testing?
-hold more data about overall game


chessboard
-this will have square to be able to reference
-will allow for multiple copies of instances to allow for no need of reverse last move i think


square
-will hold property of board square, x and y, piece and color


helper
-this will hold functions that are generic and don't fit in just one class so will be dedicated to another File
